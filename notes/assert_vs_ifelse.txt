ASSERT vs. IF/ELSE

Assert is to document your ASSUMPTIONS in the code. An if/else statement is to handle different LOGICAL scenarios.

Ex. print_number()

USING ASSERT

void
print_number(int* somePtr)
{
  assert (somePtr!=NULL);
  printf ("%d\n",*somePtr);
}

In my print_number function I ALWAYS ASSUME that the pointer is NOT null. I would be very VERY surprised if 
this is null. I DON'T CARE to handle this scenario at all in my code.

USING IF/ELSE


void
print_number(int* somePtr)
{
  if (somePtr != NULL)
       printf ("%d\n",*somePtr);
  // else do something 
}

In my print_number function, I EXPECT people to pass a null pointer. And I know how to handle this situation and 
I do handle this with an else condition.

So, sometimes you will know how to handle certain situations and you want to do that. In this case use if/else. 
Sometimes, you assume that something will not happen and you don't care to handle it. You just express your 
surprise and stop your program execution. In this case use assert.
